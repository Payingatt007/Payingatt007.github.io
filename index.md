I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, part 1

  We utilized for-loops to compute the square root of -1, which made this experiment fascinating. It was difficult for me because I had to learn how to compute square roots. After I worked it out, computing the solution using a for-loop posed only a minor challenge.

* Lab 8, part 2

  I learned how to play poker in part 2, so that made this my second favorite lab. I've always found the game to be interesting. I have since used my newfound knowledge of poker to play Texas Holdem with my friends and family and win/earn myself some money.

* Lab 12

  My most memorable lab was this one as I like every aspect of it. In the first section, I traveled back in time to right the wrongs of the past using a time machine library. I developed a program in part 2 that let me travel faster than light in order to visit far-off solar systems. It was pretty cool, reminded me of a game I had played in September called Starfield.
